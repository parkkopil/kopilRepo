The RCS-e stack is an open source implementation of the Rich Communication Suite standards for Google Android platform. This implementation is compliant to GSMA RCS-e Blackbird standards. Thanks to its client/server API, the stack may be easily integrated with existing native Android applications (e.g. address book, dialer) and permits to create new RCS applications (e.g. chat, widgets).
